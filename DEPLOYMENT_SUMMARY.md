# Social Media Downloader - Deployment Summary

## üéØ Current Status
Your social media downloader application has been fully updated with comprehensive improvements to resolve the "Failed to get video information" error that occurred after Render deployment.

## üîß Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced yt-dlp Path Detection
- **Problem**: yt-dlp was not accessible in the Render environment
- **Solution**: Implemented robust path detection across all functions:
  - `getVideoInfo()` - For fetching video metadata
  - `/api/download` - For downloading content
  - `/api/supported-sites` - For listing supported platforms

**Paths Tested (in order)**:
1. `yt-dlp` (system PATH)
2. `/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp` (common Linux location)
3. `/usr/bin/yt-dlp` (system package location)
4. `python3 -m yt_dlp` (Python module fallback)

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- **Enhanced error messages** with specific diagnostics
- **Timeout handling** for slow network requests
- **Graceful fallbacks** when yt-dlp paths fail
- **Detailed logging** for debugging deployment issues

### 3. Deployment Configuration Updates

#### Updated `render.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: social-media-downloader
    env: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: |
      npm install &&
      python3 -m pip install --user yt-dlp &&
      npm run build
    startCommand: npm start
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
```

#### Updated `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "python3 -m pip install --user yt-dlp || echo 'yt-dlp installation failed'",
    "postinstall": "python3 -m pip install --user yt-dlp || echo 'yt-dlp installation failed'"
  }
}
```

### 4. Async/Await Improvements
- **Converted callback-based file operations** to modern async/await
- **Batch processing** for file cleanup with concurrency control
- **Promise.allSettled()** for robust error handling
- **Improved cleanup function** with detailed logging

## üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment

### Option 1: Redeploy on Render (Recommended)
1. **Commit all changes** to your Git repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix yt-dlp deployment issues and improve error handling"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger Render redeploy**:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Find your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
   - Or push to your connected branch to auto-deploy

3. **Monitor deployment logs** for:
   - yt-dlp installation success
   - No build errors
   - Server startup confirmation

### Option 2: Test Locally First
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test yt-dlp installation
python3 -m pip install --user yt-dlp

# Start the server
npm start

# Test in browser at http://localhost:3000
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### If yt-dlp Still Fails After Deployment:

1. **Check Render build logs** for:
   ```
   Successfully installed yt-dlp
   ```

2. **Check application logs** for:
   ```
   Using yt-dlp path: [path]
   ```

3. **Test the health endpoint**:
   ```
   GET https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health
   ```

4. **Test video info endpoint**:
   ```
   POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/info
   Body: {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"}
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "yt-dlp not found" | Redeploy with updated `render.yaml` |
| "Permission denied" | Use `python3 -m yt_dlp` instead of direct binary |
| "Timeout" | Check network connectivity and video URL |
| "Unsupported URL" | Verify the platform is supported by yt-dlp |
